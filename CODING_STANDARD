CODING STANDARD
---------------
- indent with spaces (read .editorconfig)
- lower case function names for public-facing functions
- all CAPS for public constants. SCIC_ERR is the prefix for public constants
- math entities are mutable (conscious design choice)
- 2 vertical line breaks between functions
- blank line at the end of every file
